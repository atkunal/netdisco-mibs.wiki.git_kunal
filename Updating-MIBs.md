* Having indexes helps with verifying the MIB collection using the old `chk_*` scripts from Max
* Always run `snmptranslate -Tt` on the whole collection before changing anything, and closely inspect the diffs
* Do a lot of intermediate `snmptranslate` sequences as well, to spot errors or incompatible MIB updates

Remove all files in `/var/net-snmp/mib_indexes/`, run the command `snmptranslate -Tt | sed -re 's/ tc=[0-9]+//g'`
and redirect its output to a file, fixing items in STDERR until it's empty.

The STDOUT output is the one to compare between "starting point" and "end point" of changes.

After that `snmptranslate` routine, run the `regen_indexes.pl` script, then the `mkindex` script, then the `chk_*` scripts. Fix issues, rinse, repeat.
